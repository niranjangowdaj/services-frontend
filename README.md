/adminSignup in the home page for admin signup

###Problems to fix

- profile page is there but it is not dynamic meaning the ordered services should be interactable. 
- services page is still pending, as soon as I click book service it should start showing the status of the order and user should be able to update the status to completed when the service is complete and rate the service.
- add a service page doesn't look good yet
Now backend is important to continue. 


all the credentials are currently in users array in the db.json file, check it out.
